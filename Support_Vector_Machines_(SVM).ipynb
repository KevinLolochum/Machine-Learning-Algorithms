        "SVM is like grouping cars into categories such as MVP, Crossover, Utility, SUV,COnvertible. Sometimes a vehicle can belong to two categories but wil be considered to belong in one. Tesla model 3 can be considered as a luxury car or just a regular car. If it is considered as a luxury car then it can be used as benchmark. Anything above it in price or comfort can be considered a luxury car and anything below is put into other groups, such as hatchbacks, crossover, SUV etc. The cars that serve as benchmarks e.g Model 3 are called support vectors and can help us separate cars into multiple goups. \n",
