        "Imagine you are very successful and all you do is go around buying houses. I suppose youâ€™d consider things like living space, height of ceiling and size of the garden before you buy a house. You can put a number on all these things that will directly affect the price you are willing to pay for the house. Given such data and historical house prices, a linear regression model can predict the price that you should expect to pay.\n",
